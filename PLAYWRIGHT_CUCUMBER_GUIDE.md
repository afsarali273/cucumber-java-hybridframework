    PlaywrightElement addButton = new PlaywrightElement(
        product.getLocator().locator(".btn_inventory"), "Add button");
    addButton.click();
}
```

### 3. **Step Definitions**

- Application launch and navigation
- Login functionality
- Form interactions
- Basic validations

#### Enhanced Steps (`PlaywrightEnhancedSteps.java`)
- Performance testing
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility validation

- Advanced user interactions

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Login Test
```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given Launch Playwright Application using "SeleniumPracticeTest4"
  Then verify playwright login page displayed successfully
  When User enters userCredentials in playwright text field
  And User clicks playwright Login button
  Then verify playwright home page displayed successfully
```

### Data-Driven Testing
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Data-driven login testing
  When User enters "<username>" and "<password>" using playwright
  And User clicks playwright Login button
  Then verify login result is "<expected_result>" using playwright

  Examples:
    | username        | password     | expected_result |
    | standard_user   | secret_sauce | success         |
    | locked_out_user | secret_sauce | error           |
    | invalid_user    | wrong_pass   | error           |
```

### E2E Shopping Flow
```gherkin
Scenario: Complete shopping flow
  When User enters userCredentials in playwright text field
  And User clicks playwright Login button
  When User adds multiple products to cart using playwright:
    | Sauce Labs Backpack    |
    | Sauce Labs Bike Light  |
    | Sauce Labs Bolt T-Shirt|
  Then verify cart count is 3 using playwright
```

### Responsive Testing
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Cross-browser responsive testing
  When User sets viewport to "<width>x<height>" using playwright
  Then verify playwright login page displayed successfully
  When User enters userCredentials in playwright text field
  And User clicks playwright Login button
  Then verify page layout is responsive using playwright

  Examples:
    | width | height |
    | 1920  | 1080   |
    | 768   | 1024   |
    | 375   | 667    |
```

## üéØ Key Advantages Over Selenium

### 1. **Auto-Wait Capabilities**
```java
// Playwright - No explicit waits needed
usernameField.fill("testuser");
loginButton.click();

// vs Selenium - Requires explicit waits
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(usernameField));
usernameField.sendKeys("testuser");
```

### 2. **Modern Selectors**
```java
// Text-based selectors
@FindBy(text = "Sign In")
private PlaywrightElement signInButton;

// Role-based selectors
@FindBy(role = "button")
private PlaywrightElement submitButton;

// Test ID selectors (recommended)
@FindBy(testId = "login-submit")
private PlaywrightElement loginSubmit;
```

### 3. **Built-in Network Control**
```java
// Intercept and mock API calls
page.route("**/api/users", route -> {
    route.fulfill(new Route.FulfillOptions()
        .setStatus(200)
        .setBody("{\"users\": []}"));
});
```

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
```java
// Built-in tracing and video recording
context.tracing().start(new Tracing.StartOptions()
    .setScreenshots(true)
    .setSnapshots(true));

// Element highlighting
element.getLocator().highlight();
```

## üîß Configuration

### Properties Setup
```properties
# Playwright Settings
PlaywrightHeadless=false
PlaywrightSlowMo=0
PlaywrightTimeout=30000
PlaywrightViewportWidth=1920
PlaywrightViewportHeight=1080
PlaywrightRecordVideo=false
PlaywrightTracing=false
```

### Test Configuration
```properties
TestConfigurationID=PLAYWRIGHTChrome
ExecutionApproach=CUCUMBER
```

## üö¶ Running Tests

### Command Line Execution
```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Playwright"

# Run specific test types
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@PlaywrightLogin"
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@PlaywrightE2E"
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@PlaywrightResponsive"

# Run with specific browser
mvn test -DPlaywrightBrowser=firefox -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Playwright"

# Run in headless mode
mvn test -DPlaywrightHeadless=true -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@Playwright"
```

### IDE Execution
1. Right-click on feature file
2. Select "Run as Cucumber Feature"
3. Or run individual scenarios by right-clicking on scenario

## üìä Test Reports

### Cucumber Reports
- HTML reports generated in `target/cucumber-reports/`
- JSON reports for CI/CD integration
- Screenshots automatically attached to failed steps

### Playwright Traces
- Detailed execution traces when enabled
- Network activity logs
- Console logs and errors
- Performance metrics

### Visual Reports
- Screenshot comparisons
- Element highlighting
- Page layout validation

## üîç Debugging Features

### 1. **Interactive Debugging**
```java
// Pause execution for manual inspection
page.pause();

// Step-by-step debugging
page.setDefaultTimeout(0); // Disable timeouts for debugging
```

### 2. **Element Inspection**
```java
// Highlight elements
element.getLocator().highlight();

// Get element information
System.out.println("Element visible: " + element.isVisible());
System.out.println("Element text: " + element.getText());
```

### 3. **Network Monitoring**
```java
// Monitor network requests
page.onRequest(request -> {
    System.out.println("Request: " + request.url());
});

page.onResponse(response -> {
    System.out.println("Response: " + response.status());
});
```

## üé® Best Practices

### 1. **Page Object Design**
```java
// Good - Focused page objects
public class LoginPage extends BasePage {
    // Only login-related elements and methods
}

public class InventoryPage extends BasePage {
    // Only inventory-related elements and methods
}

// Avoid - Monolithic page objects
public class WebPage extends BasePage {
    // All elements from all pages - harder to maintain
}
```

### 2. **Element Locators**
```java
// Preferred - Stable locators
@FindBy(testId = "login-button")
@FindBy(role = "button")
@FindBy(text = "Sign In")

// Avoid - Fragile locators
@FindBy(xpath = "//div[3]/form/button[1]")
@FindBy(css = "div > button:nth-child(2)")
```

### 3. **Wait Strategies**
```java
// Good - Specific waits
element.waitForVisible(10);
waitForNetworkIdle();

// Avoid - Generic delays
Thread.sleep(5000);
waitFor(5);
```

### 4. **Error Handling**
```java
public void safeClick(PlaywrightElement element) {
    try {
        element.waitForVisible(10);
        element.click();
        addTestLog("Click", "Element clicked successfully", Status.PASS);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        takeScreenshot("click_error.png");
        addTestLog("Click", "Failed to click: " + e.getMessage(), Status.FAIL);
        throw e;
    }
}
```

## üîÑ Migration from Selenium

### Step-by-Step Migration
1. **Create Playwright versions** of existing page objects
2. **Update step definitions** to use Playwright methods
3. **Create new feature files** with Playwright-specific tags
4. **Run tests in parallel** during transition period
5. **Gradually phase out** Selenium tests

### Comparison Table
| Feature | Selenium | Playwright |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Auto-wait | Manual | Built-in |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast |
| Browser support | Wide | Modern browsers |
| Network control | Limited | Full control |
| Mobile testing | Appium needed | Built-in emulation |
| Debugging | Basic | Advanced tracing |

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### 1. **Performance Testing**
```gherkin
Scenario: Performance validation
  When User measures page load time using playwright
  Then verify page loads within 3 seconds using playwright
```

### 2. **Visual Testing**
```gherkin
Scenario: Visual regression testing
  Then take visual baseline screenshot for login page using playwright
  And compare visual changes using playwright
```

### 3. **Accessibility Testing**
```gherkin
Scenario: Accessibility validation
  Then verify playwright login page accessibility
  And verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible using playwright
```

This comprehensive Playwright integration provides a modern, reliable, and feature-rich alternative to Selenium testing while maintaining full compatibility with the existing QualiFrameV2 framework structure.
